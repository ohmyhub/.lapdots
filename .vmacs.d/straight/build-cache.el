Otherwise, the repository is cloned, if it is missing. If

package name as a string. In that case, the return value of the
function is used as the value of NO-BUILD instead. In any case,

                 execute until the lazy load has occurred.

                 can be used to define functions for use in `:if', or that
                 should be seen by the byte-compiler.

:magic           Form to be added to `magic-mode-alist'.
:magic-fallback  Form to be added to `magic-fallback-mode-alist'.
:interpreter     Form to be added to `interpreter-mode-alist'.

:commands        Define autoloads for commands that will be defined by the
                 package.  This is useful if the package is being lazily
                 loaded, and you wish to conditionally call functions in your
                 `:init' block that are defined in the package.
:hook            Specify hook(s) to attach this package to.

:bind            Bind keys, and define autoloads for the bound commands.
:bind*           Bind keys, and define autoloads for the bound commands,
                 *overriding all minor mode bindings*.
:bind-keymap     Bind a key prefix to an auto-loaded keymap defined in the

:bind-keymap*    Like `:bind-keymap', but overrides all minor mode bindings

                 `:magic-fallback', or `:interpreter'.  This can be an integer,
                 to force loading after N seconds of idle time, if the package
                 has not already been loaded.
:after           Delay the use-package declaration until after the named modules
                 have loaded. Once load, it will be as though the use-package
                 declaration (without `:after') had been seen at that moment.
:demand          Prevent the automatic deferred loading introduced by constructs
                 such as `:bind' (see `:defer' for the complete list).

:if EXPR         Initialize and load only if EXPR evaluates to a non-nil value.
:disabled        The package is ignored completely if this keyword is present.
:defines         Declare certain variables to silence the byte-compiler.
:functions       Declare certain functions to silence the byte-compiler.
:load-path       Add to the `load-path' before attempting to load the package.
:diminish        Support for diminish.el (if installed).
:delight         Support for delight.el (if installed).
:custom          Call `custom-set' or `set-default' with each variable
                 definition without modifying the Emacs `custom-file'.
                 (compare with `custom-set-variables').
:custom-face     Call `customize-set-faces' with each face definition.
:ensure          Loads the package using package.el if necessary.
:pin             Pin the package to an archive.
